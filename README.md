# Meal Time

Meal Time is an Android application that helps you cook two or more frozen foods simultaneously by finding a common cooking temperature and calculating the time to cook each item.

## Instructions

1. Input the quantity of different foods you want to cook simultaneously.
2. Insert the name, the cooking temperature, and the cooking time (in minutes) for the food you want to cook.
3. Repeat for all subsequent foods.
4. Voila! The oven temperature and time to set your timers are presented.

## Disclaimer

I am in no way, shape, and/or form responsible for any burnt/undercooked foods, destroyed appliances, cooked persons, or homes engulfed in flames from the use of this application. 
This application uses the Degree Cooking Method, which is not without flaw. It assumes all foods require the same heat energy, though that is seldom the case. Adjust the actual cooking times as needed. *Use at your own risk!*
